Project I did for CS350. Uses machine learning to identify personal names in documents. 

We struggled with the Build and Config management. I'm not sure that this would build properly on any machine other than the ones used to develop it. 
Theoretically, you would build this project using the Ant build management tool. Dependencies are: 

Ant
Ivy
JaCoCo
Java
JUnit
Weka
