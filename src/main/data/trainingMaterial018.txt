Could there be a vegetarian gene? 
Cornell University researchers have found evidence 
of a genetic variation - called an allele - 
that has evolved in populations that have historically 
favored vegetarian diets, such as in India, Africa and parts 
of East Asia. They also discovered a different version of this 
gene adapted to a marine diet discovered among the Inuit in 
Greenland, who mainly consume seafood.</NER>
<NER>

The vegetarian allele evolved in populations that have eaten 
a plant-based diet over hundreds of generations. The adaptation 
allows these people to efficiently process omega-3 and omega-6 
fatty acids and convert them into compounds essential for early 
brain development and if they stray from a balanced omega-6 to 
omega-3 diet, it may make people more susceptible to inflammation,
 and by association, increased risk of heart disease and colon cancer.</NER>
<NER>

In Inuit populations of Greenland, the researchers uncovered 
that a previously identified adaptation is opposite to the one 
found in long-standing vegetarian populations: While the vegetarian 
allele has an insertion of 22 bases (a base is a building block 
of DNA) within the gene, this insertion was found to be deleted in the seafood allele.</NER>

"The opposite allele is likely driving adaptation in Inuit," 
said <PER>Kaixiong Ye</PER>, co-lead author of the paper appearing March 29
 in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. <PERYe</PER> is a postdoctoral 
researcher in the lab of <PER>Alon Keinan</PER>, associate professor of biological 
statistics and computational biology, and the paper's co-senior author.

"Our study is the first to connect an insertion allele with vegetarian 
diets, and the deletion allele with a marine diet," <PER>Ye</PER> said.

Malaria affects close to 500 million people every year, 
but we're not the only ones—different species of malaria 
parasite can infect birds, bats, and other mammals too. 
A Field Museum study published in Molecular Phylogenetics 
and Evolution reveals a new take on the evolution of different 
malaria species and contributes to the ongoing search for the 
origins of malaria in humans."We can't begin to understand how
 malaria spread to humans until we understand its evolutionary history," 
explained lead author <PER>Holly Lutz</PER>, a Ph.D. candidate at 
Cornell University and a longtime affiliate of The Field Museum. "
In learning about its past, we may be better able to understand 
the effects it has on us."

Malaria is a parasitic single-celled organism that reproduces in 
the bloodstream of its host and is transferred between hosts by 
insects like mosquitos. Different species of malaria live in 
different species of host animals. <PER>Lutz</PER> and her colleagues took blood 
samples from hundreds of East African birds, bats, and other mammals 
and screened the blood for the parasites. When they found malaria, 
they took samples of the parasites' DNA and sequenced it to identify 
mutations in the genetic code. From there, <PER>Lutz</PER> was able to perform 
what is called "phylogenetic analyses" to determine how different 
malaria species are related.
</NER><NER>
In analyzing the genetic codes of the malaria parasites, <PER>Lutz</PER> was 
able to find places where the DNA differed from one species to the next. 
Then, the scientists used powerful computing software to determine how 
the different species evolved and how they're related to each other.
</NER><NER>
This phylogenetic analysis relied on large sample sizes and DNA from many 
different host species of bats and birds, because otherwise, the picture 
would be incomplete—"Trying to determine the evolutionary history of malaria 
from just a few specimens would be like trying to reconstruct the bird 
family tree when you only know about eagles and canaries," explained <PER>Lutz</PER>.
 "There's still more to discover, but this is the most complete analysis
 of its kind for malaria to date."
