A team of Japanese researchers (and one from the U.K.) has found evidence 
in the remains of ancient Japanese people that suggests that people are not 
necessarily predisposed to living a violent existence or even to engaging 
in warfare. In their paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology 
Letters, the team describes their analysis of the remains of people that 
lived during the Jomon period (from 13,000 – 800 BC) in what is now Japan, 
which showed very little evidence of violent behavior or death.</NER>

<NER>
In recent years, scientists have found evidence of many hunter-gatherer 
groups that behaved in a violent manner, sometimes even banding together 
to wage war on other people or groups. That has led to more evidence of the
 common assumption that humans are inherently violent and that war has 
generally been the result when two or more groups have different ideas 
of how things should be done. In this new effort, the researchers suggest 
such findings might be premature as they have found an example of an early
 hunter-gatherer culture that did not appear to wage war or even behave in a violent manner.

<NER>

The teams' study consisted of analyzing the remains of approximately 2,500 
people that lived in Japan during the Jomon period, looking for examples of 
violence, e.g. broken or damaged bones. The team reports that they found 
evidence of violence in just 1.8 percent of all the adult bones represented 
and in just 0.89 percent of the population as a whole. A very low number 
compared to the 12 to 14 percent seen in other hunter-gatherer populations 
of around the same time period (which strongly suggested a violent existence). 
This, the researchers claim, suggests that the people of that time lived 
peacefully among themselves and did not conduct war against others that 
might have lived nearby. And that, they add, suggests that humans may not 
be quite as predisposed to violence as others have suggested, which counters other 
arguments that it was warfare that led people to band together into groups 
forming communities that allowed for the promotion of intra-group altruism 
and even more advanced warfare against other such groups—a selective from of 
evolutionary behavior.

<PER>Chevalier Blondin</PER> was 35 years old when in 1859, with no safety harness 
and no net beneath him, he first tightrope-walked nearly half a kilometre across 
the Niagara Gorge. At different times over the coming years, 
he would repeat the crossing blindfolded, carrying a 
stove (stopping to cook himself an omelette half way), 
and with his manager on his back. Later on, during a visit to the UK, 
he crossed a tightrope while pushing a wheelbarrow with a lion in it. 
<PER>Chevalier Blondin</PER> was a risk taker.</NER>
<NER>
In the same year as <PER>Blondin</PER>'s first Niagara crossing, 
<PER>Charles Darwin</PER> published On The Origin of Species by Natural Selection. 
There may seem to be a gulf the width of Niagara between these two events,
 but perhaps there is more to link them than is at first apparent.</NER>
<NER>
Some may find <PER>Blondin</PER>'s exploits admirable and inspirational. 
Others may think he was mad. The difference illustrates how individuals 
have remarkably different attitudes to risk. Some take up extreme 
sports and visit war zones. Others view the ability to stay at home and 
live a quiet life as the happy privilege of the human species. </NER>
<NER>
But humans are not alone in having varying attitudes to risk.
 From field crickets to fighting fish and hermit crabs to hamsters, 
individuals differ consistently in their willingness to be exposed to risk.</NER>
<NER>
Behavioural ecologists call this spectrum of responses "boldness", 
and researchers in the field of animal personality variation are 
exploring its evolutionary significance.

The first question to address is why do some individuals take 
more risks than others? One answer is that in some cases,
 bolder individuals have higher reproductive success.
