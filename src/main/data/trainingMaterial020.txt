OKLAHOMA CITY –  
Authorities are responding to wildfires in Oklahoma and Kansas 
that have led to evacuations, scorched mostly rural land and destroyed 
an unknown number of structures.
</NER><NER>

In Oklahoma, the largest fire was in the same area near the border 
with Kansas where blazes last month scorched hundreds of square miles.

Authorities there urged the approximately 300 residents of Freedom, 
about 170 miles northwest of Oklahoma City, to evacuate, Woods County 
Emergency Management Director <PER>Steve Foster</PER> said.

The fire was burning uncontrolled, stoked by wind gusts of around 40 miles per hour, 
said Woodward County Emergency Management Director <PER>Matt Lehenbauer</PER>.

By late evening Tuesday, the flames had stalled at the Cimarron River 
west of Freedom, but officials remained wary of its potential threat to the town.</NER>

A video that captured a retired U.S. Air Force sergeant being forcibly 
removed from a ceremony at a California base has prompted an investigation, 
an Air Force Reserve official said Wednesday.</NER><NER>


The incident occurred at Travis Air Force Base, near Sacramento on April 3, 
at the retirement of an unidentified master sergeant from the 749th Aircraft 
Maintenance Squadron. Retired Senior Master <PER>Sgt. Oscar Rodriguez</PER>, in civilian 
clothing, is shown attempting to read a statement before three uniformed airmen 
forcibly remove him.</NER><NER>


The 50-second video clip was first posted on JQPublicBlog.com, which 
called the footage “a disgraceful spectacle” during what is usually a calm send off.</NER><NER>


A source who was present at the event told the military blog that <PER>Rodriguez</PER> was 
there at the request of the retiree, but had been banned from the base by the squadron commander.
</NER><NER>


A spokesman from the reserve said that the confrontation stemmed from 
“an unplanned participation” at the event.

"<PER>Rodriguez</PER> ignored numerous requests to respect the Air Force prescribed ceremony
 and unfortunately was forcibly removed," a Travis official said in a statement 
to FoxNews.com. "We will continue to investigate the situation fully."
</NER><NER>


Neither <PER>Rodriguez</PER> nor the honoree could be reached for comment.
</NER><NER>


<PER>Stephan Sila</PER>, who identified himself as the officiating officer at the ceremony
 and a 28-year Air Force veteran, wrote in a Facebook post published on the military
 blog that <PER>Rodriguez</PER> simply planned to read a statement honoring the flag and 
that his appearance had been cleared through the proper chain of command.</NER><NER>


<PER>Sila</PER> said the incident has angered non-commissioned officers who believe the 
retirement ceremony was marred by the ugly incident.</NER><NER>


"Why do you think people are leaving (the Air Force) in droves?" <PER>Sila</PER> wrote. 
</NER><NER>

"Because the guys in the trenches are subjected to nonstop stupidity from 
commanders who don’t deserve the rank, respect, or support of the people ther’re in charge of.”</NER><NER>


The Air Force Reserve said in the statement it "respects and defends the right to
 free speech and religious expression." </NER>

State officials say a sewage leak has caused a major fish kill in a lake near 
the Mississippi River in west Tennessee.</NER><NER>


<PER>Kelly Brockman</PER>, a spokeswoman with the Tennessee's Department of Environment 
and Conservation, said Tuesday that the number of fish killed in McKellar 
Lake in Memphis is in the thousands.</NER><NER>


Officials say a broken sewage line is dumping up to 50 million gallons of 
untreated wastewater per day into Cypress Creek. 

</NER><NER>
The leak into the creek 
began Thursday. The creek runs into McKellar Lake, which flows into the 
Mississippi. Officials say the creek and the lake are not sources of drinking water.</NER><NER>


Officials have said the spill poses no immediate risk to the public, but they also
 said people should avoid touching or fishing in both bodies of water. </NER><NER>

City crews have placed warning signs in the area near the creek, and a 
marina that provides access to the lake has been closed.
</NER><NER>


Memphis public works officials have said a bypass around the damaged 
section of line is estimated to be in place on Wednesday.

Construction to replace the sewer line could take three to four months, 
with an estimated repair cost of $8 million to $10 million, said <PER>Robert Knecht</PER>, 
director of the Memphis Public Works Division.</NER>
