 Executive Summary 
 Progress during the past six months is described on the project"Effects of Subzero Temperatures 
 and Sea water Immersion on Damage Initiation and Growth in Sandwich Composites."Efforts 
 during this period have focused on (1) assessing the effects of environment and impact damage 
 on the flexural response of sandwich laminates, (2) finalizing the improved modified peel test 
 and associated data reduction method for determining the debonding toughness of sandwich 
 structures, and (3) using this new test to assessment the toughness of sandwich structures with 
 different face sheet materials under a variety of environments. In the first focus area, the 
 proposed test matrix has been completed and a few final follow-up tests are currently being 
 performed to address areas where there is large scatter in the data or where unexpected behaviors 
 were observed. The data obtained are used to draw a number of preliminary conclusions about 
 the effects of temperature, sea water saturation, and impact damage on the static strength, static 
 stiffness, fatigue strength, fatigue stiffness and life of sandwich laminates. Work in the second 
 and third focus areas has been completed. One publication has been prepared documenting the 
 results of focus area (2) and will appear in"Major Accomplishments in Composite Materials and 
 Sandwich Structures - An Anthology of ONR Sponsored Research,"edited by I. M. Daniel, E. E. 
 Gdoutos, and Y. D. S. Rajapakse. Work is currently underway documenting the results of focus 
 area (3) in the form of a paper for archival journal publication</NER>

 Abstract- We present a high yield filling technique of multi- 
 walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), grown vertically on a SiO 2 
 substrate, with magnetic nanoparticles using pulsed laser 
 deposition (PLD). Magnetization measurements in-plane and out- 
 of-plane with respect to the sample surface indicate reasonable 
 coercivity estimated at 0.4 T. The magnetic anisotropy is however 
 found to be randomly oriented, indicating a polycrystalline 
 structure. The unique difference between the in-plane and out-of- 
 plane magnetizations is the sharing produced by the 
 demagnetizing field in the perpendicular direction</NER>

 LONG-TERM GOALS 
 We wish to develop the theoretical and computational groundwork for a new and innovative program 
 for the remote detection and characterization of both organic and inorganic aerosols using both active 
 (lidar) and passive techniques. This aerosol study should be very beneficial to the Navy in the areas of 
 communications, high power laser transmission, air-sea interactions, and standoff biological detection 
 methods. We also want to continue our collaborative program in polarimetry with the group in Minsk 
 headed by Dr. Eleonora Zege</NER>

 The deleterious consequences of fatigue have motivated decades of research to understand the 
 impact of inadequate sleep on cognitive performance. A key objective is to use insights from that 
 research to develop predictive models that can serve as valid tools for managing work - rest 
 schedules and making Go, No - Go mission decisions. Ultimately, this is about maximizing 
 human performance and minimizing risk. In this paper, we describe a methodology that is 
 moving us in the direction of achieving this goal, involving the integration of mathematical and 
 computational process modeling approaches to understand how fatigue affects human cognitive 
 processes. Mathematical models that capture the dynamics of the human arousal system are 
 integrated with a cognitive architecture that instantiates a unified theory of the mechanisms of 
 human cognition. The integration of these approaches leads to an enhanced ability to quantify the 
 impact of fatigue on performance in particular tasks. We illustrate this by making principled, a 
 priori predictions regarding how human performance in instrument flight with a Predator UAV 
 synthetic task environment may change across 4 days without sleep</NER>

 This article will discuss the merging of Unified Modeling Language (UML) with"what you see is what you get"(WYSIWYG) 
 graphical user interface (GUI) tools. The topics presented-and discussion of an example with benefits and hazards-will 
 show that the merged solution can increase productivity and provide an improved rapid prototyping platform. 
 T his work article done is on a based project on the at Hill current Air 
 Force Base, which is based on the Team 
 Software Process SM (TSP SM) practices in 
 the CMMI ? Level 5 organization. One of 
 the requirements of our customer is that 
 the project should use a model-driven 
 design UML toolset, namely Rational 
 Rose RealTime. This project is tasked with 
 the design and development of a real-time 
 control system based on C + + auto-gener- 
 ated code. In addition, the project selected 
 to use the Tilcon Interface Development 
 Suite (IDS) in order to rapidly and effi- 
 ciently create graphical interfaces for the 
 real-time control system that generates 
 stunning displays to the operators of the 
 system at a fraction of the time or exper- 
 tise otherwise needed. 
 Overview of UML 
 The focus of UML is to model systems 
 using object-oriented concepts and 
 methodology. UML consists of a set of 
 model elements that standardize the 
 design description. These elements 
 include a number of fundamental basic 
 model elements and modeling concepts, in 
 addition to views that allow designers to 
 examine a design from different perspec- 
 tives and diagrams to illustrate the rela- 
 tionships among model elements. 
 Several views-such as Use Case View, 
 Logical View, Component View, Concur- 
 rency View, and Deployment View-cre- 
 ate a complete description of the system 
 design. Within each view, an organized set 
 of diagrams and other model elements are 
 visible. Diagrams include use case dia- 
 grams, class diagrams, object diagrams, 
 sequence diagrams, collaboration dia- 
 grams, state-chart diagrams, activity dia- 
 grams, component diagrams, and deploy- 
 ment diagrams. Some key primitive model 
 elements are states, transitions, signals, 
 classes, class roles, attributes, and opera- 
 tions [ 1 ]. 
 SM Team Software Process and TSP are service marks of 
 Carnegie Mellon University. 
 ? CMMI is registered in the U. S. Patent and Trademark 
 Office by Carnegie Mellon University. 
 The object-oriented principles (OOP) 
 used for the UML design and develop- 
 ment are based on the idea of creating 
 self-contained modules that describe 
 desired functionality and interact with oth- 
 ers through interfaces in order to create a 
 complete system. To achieve this goal, 
 some of the techniques available with 
 OOP include encapsulation and abstrac- 
 tion [ 2, 3 ]. 
"The UML language is 
 complete enough to 
 allow the creation of 
 auto-generated code that 
 implements the design. 
 The code can be 
 generated from the 
 system description of the 
 model through the use of 
 diagrams and other 
 model elements."
 Encapsulation describes the grouping 
 of related functionality, which separates 
 implementation from interface. The 
 implementation details are hidden from 
 outside users, who can only interact with 
 objects of the class through the interface. 
 In this way, the implementation can be 
 more easily changed</NER>

 ABSTACT 
 Gas-centered swirl-coaxial (GCSC) injectors have enjoyed much recent interest for use in LOX- 
 hydrocarbon rocket engines in the US. (Prior to injection, the LOX is vaporized and combusted in a 
 preburner and is introduced to the combustion chamber as gas.) Many GCSC injectors feature a dividing 
 plate between the initial liquid fuel flow and the gaseous oxidizer flow. Generally this plate terminates 
 with some thickness producing separated gas flow just prior to contact with the liquid. This recirculation 
 zone and other flow factors cause the film and spray to be nonuniform in space and time. These 
 nonuniformities are discussed in detail and suggestions are given for producing more uniform and 
 predictable sprays. In addition to the influence of geometry, the impact of operating conditions is included 
 in 
 these 
 studies</NER>

 We propose and evaluate a metric for the value proposition of bit rate 
 adaptive transmission in the form of the quasi-static multiplicative increase 
 in network traf?c that could be supported by an optical network without 
 increasing the number of wavelength channels or spectral bandwidth. Under 
 the assumption of idealized bit rate adaptive transmission, we assess the 
 increase in network traf?c throughput, or traf?c gain, using the network 
 global expectation model methodology and recent results and observations 
 for the capacity limits of optical ?ber transmission and the distance- 
 dependence of capacity deployments. Depending upon the details of the 
 optical transmission system technology, network topology, and traf?c- 
 in?uenced capacity pro?le, we estimate ideal potential network mean traf?c 
 gains in the range of 1.5 X to 4 X. ? 20 10 Alcatel-Lucent</NER>

 (Recei v ed 24 March 20 00 and accepted in re v ised form 8 September 20 00) 
 Although various methods exist for performing usability evaluation, they lack a system- 
 atic framework for guiding and structuring the assessment and reporting activities. 
 Consequently, analysis and reporting of usability data are ad hoc and do not live up to 
 their potential in cost e ! ectiveness, and usability engineering support tools are not well 
 integrated. We developed the User Action Framework, a structured knowledge base of 
 usability concepts and issues, as a framework on which to build a broad suite of usability 
 engineering support tools. The User Action Framework helps to guide the development 
 of each tool and to integrate the set of tools in the practitioner ' s working environment. 
 An important characteristic of the User Action Framework is its own reliability in term 
 of consistent use by practitioners. Consistent understanding and reporting of the under- 
 lying causes of usability problems are requirements for cost-e ! ective analysis and re- 
 design. Thus, high reliability in terms of agreement by users on what the User Action 
 Framework means and how it is used is essential for its role as a common foundation for 
 the tools. Here we describe how we achieved high reliability in the User Action Frame- 
 work, and we support the claim with strongly positive results of a summative reliability 
 study conducted to measure agreement among 10 usability experts in classifying 15 
 di ! erent usability problems. Reliability data from the User Action Framework are also 
 compared to data collected from nine of the same usability experts using a classic 
 heuristic evaluation technique.

 [ Editor's Note. The following report continues our series of feature articles on countries 
 where the United States manages significant security assistance programs. Overall U. S. relations 
 with Brazil are substantial : the U. S. is Brazil's single most important export market, as well as its 
 largest single supplier of imports, its largest source of bank financing, and its largest foreign 
 investor. The close World War II cooperation between the Brazilian Expeditionary Force and die 
 U. S. Army in Italy, as illustrated below, was the beginning of a relationship that continues today 
 through the security assistance and related activities of the U. S. Military Liaison Office in Brazil.</NER>

 [ The following arc extracts from an unclassified report of conventional arms transfers as published 
 under the above title by the Library of Congress on 29 July 19 94. The selections included herein 
 begin with a discussion of major research findings regarding the dollar value of both arms transfer 
 agreements and arms deliveries to the Third World from 19 86 through 19 93. These findings are 
 all cross-referenced to comparative data tables which are presented following the textual material. 
 Special attention is given to the roles of the United States, the former Soviet Union, and China as 
 arms suppliers, to arms trade with Iran and Iraq, and to identification of the leading Third World 
 arms recipient nations. The report concludes with a listing of the type and quantity of weapons 
 delivered to the Third World by major arms suppliers in the 19 86 - 19 93 time period. Copies of the 
 complete 92 page study (Report No.94 - 61 2 F) are available from the Foreign Affairs and National 
 Defense Division, Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress, Washington</NER>

 [ The following are extracts from an unclassified report of conventional arms transfers to 
 developing nations as published under the above title by the Library of Congress on July 31, 
 selections included herein begin with a discussion of major research findings regarding the dollar 
 through 19 98. These findings are all cross-referenced to comparative data tables which are 
 presented following the textual material. Special attention is given to the roles of the United 
 States, the former Soviet Union, and China as arms suppliers, and to identification of the leading 
 Third World arms recipient nations. The report concludes with a listing of the type and quantity 
 of weapons delivered to developing nations by major arms suppliers in the 19 91 - 19 98 time 
 period. Copies of the complete document are available from the Foreign Affairs and National 
 Defense Division, Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress, Washington</NER>

<NER>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 This report summarizes research performed as part of the project"Design of Ultra-High 
 Temperature Ceramics for Improved Performance,"which was funded by AFOSR grant 
 FA 95 50 - 06 - 1 - 01 25. The report describes the technical progress and lists all of the publications 
 and presentations that stemmed from the project. The report also describes interactions between 
 the project team and other researchers from around the world. In addition to the technical 
 content, the appendices describe two related subjects. The first appendix is a trip report prepared 
 after the principal investigators attended the Fifth China International Conference on Ceramics in 
 were investigating ultra-high temperature ceramics. The final appendix describes and lists 
 additional projects related to boride and carbide ceramics that were active during the 
 performance of this project. This AFOSR project was part of a larger effort at the Missouri 
 University of Science and Technology that has become one of the largest research groups in the 
 world focused on these unique materials. 
 The goal of the project was to understand the influence of composition and structure on 
 elevated temperature behavior of ZrB 2 -based ultra-high temperature ceramics. A combined 
 experimental and modeling approach was used to gain the maximum fundamental understanding 
 from a minimum number of experiments. The technical focus areas for the project were : 1) 
 adapting mechanical models to monolithic, particulate reinforced, and fibrous monolithic 
 UHTCs ; 2) fabricating compositions and structures for testing and model evaluation by hot 
 pressing, reactive hot pressing, sintering, and / or co-extrusion followed by hot pressing ; 3) 
 characterizing thermomechanical properties and thermal shock behavior. 
 Significant technical progress was made in several areas. First, the thermal shock 
 behavior was characterized for conventional SiC particulate reinforced ZrB ^ ceramics and then 
 improved by engineering the meso-scale structure of a novel ZrB 2 -SiC fibrous monolith. 
 Whereas monolithic ZrB 2 and ZrB 2 reinforced by 30 vol % SiC particulates both lost strength 
 after quenching to room temperature from ~ 40 0 ? C, the fibrous monolith architecture could 
 withstand quenching from 14 00 ? C without loss of strength. The improvement was due to crack 
 propagation being isolated to only the cell boundary phase. Finite element modeling was used to 
 calculate and understand how parameters such as SiC particle size and shape affected the 
 distribution of residual thermal stresses. Models experimental results that larger SiC particles led 
 to residual stresses that affected a greater volume of the surrounding ZrB 2 matrix, but that the 
 magnitude of the residual stresses did not vary significantly with particle size. Elevated 
 temperature neutron diffraction experiments were used to validate and confirm the models. 
 Further investigations of the effect of SiC distribution on the residual stresses in ZrB 2 -SiC 
 ceramics continue utilizing Raman spectroscopy. This work included designing and fabricating 
 unique spiral architectures that were specifically constructed to mitigate thermal stresses. 
 The primary results of this research are detailed in the technical publications that resulted 
 from the thesis and dissertation research of the graduate students. A complete list of publications 
 and abstracts of the student thesis and dissertation documents are included in this report.

<NER>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 This report summarizes research performed as part of the project"Design of Ultra-High 
 Temperature Ceramics for Improved Performance,"which was funded by AFOSR grant 
 FA 95 50 - 06 - 1 - 01 25. The report describes the technical progress and lists all of the publications 
 and presentations that stemmed from the project. The report also describes interactions between 
 the project team and other researchers from around the world. In addition to the technical 
 content, the appendices describe two related subjects. The first appendix is a trip report prepared 
 after the principal investigators attended the Fifth China International Conference on Ceramics in 
 were investigating ultra-high temperature ceramics. The final appendix describes and lists 
 additional projects related to boride and carbide ceramics that were active during the 
 performance of this project. This AFOSR project was part of a larger effort at the Missouri 
 University of Science and Technology that has become one of the largest research groups in the 
 world focused on these unique materials. 
 The goal of the project was to understand the influence of composition and structure on 
 elevated temperature behavior of ZrB 2 -based ultra-high temperature ceramics. A combined 
 experimental and modeling approach was used to gain the maximum fundamental understanding 
 from a minimum number of experiments. The technical focus areas for the project were : 1) 
 adapting mechanical models to monolithic, particulate reinforced, and fibrous monolithic 
 UHTCs ; 2) fabricating compositions and structures for testing and model evaluation by hot 
 pressing, reactive hot pressing, sintering, and / or co-extrusion followed by hot pressing ; 3) 
 characterizing thermomechanical properties and thermal shock behavior. 
 Significant technical progress was made in several areas. First, the thermal shock 
 behavior was characterized for conventional SiC particulate reinforced ZrB ^ ceramics and then 
 improved by engineering the meso-scale structure of a novel ZrB 2 -SiC fibrous monolith. 
 Whereas monolithic ZrB 2 and ZrB 2 reinforced by 30 vol % SiC particulates both lost strength 
 after quenching to room temperature from ~ 40 0 ? C, the fibrous monolith architecture could 
 withstand quenching from 14 00 ? C without loss of strength. The improvement was due to crack 
 propagation being isolated to only the cell boundary phase. Finite element modeling was used to 
 calculate and understand how parameters such as SiC particle size and shape affected the 
 distribution of residual thermal stresses. Models experimental results that larger SiC particles led 
 to residual stresses that affected a greater volume of the surrounding ZrB 2 matrix, but that the 
 magnitude of the residual stresses did not vary significantly with particle size. Elevated 
 temperature neutron diffraction experiments were used to validate and confirm the models. 
 Further investigations of the effect of SiC distribution on the residual stresses in ZrB 2 -SiC 
 ceramics continue utilizing Raman spectroscopy. This work included designing and fabricating 
 unique spiral architectures that were specifically constructed to mitigate thermal stresses.

 iMAST Senior Scientist Honored 
 Exercising superb leadership and technical expertise, Dr. William Mark, a Senior 
 Scientist within ARL's Drivetrain Technology Center (DTC), was recently awarded the 
 Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award for his unique and outstanding performance 
 while serving as lead analyst and designer for a mechanical modification that resulted 
 in improved operational submarine performance. This award is the second highest 
 civilian award given by the Navy. Recipients who are nominated for the award must 
 also have an established pattern of excellence before they can be considered. 
 Dr. Mark's success was spawned as a result of his U. S. Navy ManTech 
 efforts under an iMAST project titled :"Gear Metrology and Performance 
 Prediction"(project S 07 28). Cited for his ability to innovatively apply his 
 exceptional technical expertise, Rear Admiral J. R. Davis, USN, Program 
 Executive Officer for Submarines, also acknowledged the difficult conditions 
 confronting Dr. Mark during the course of his effort. His ability to innovate 
 under these trying conditions was cited by the admiral as a noteworthy 
 achievement in its own right. Admiral Davis further notes that Dr. Mark's work 
 served the best interests of the Naval Sea Systems Command and the U. S. Navy. 
 Providing a direct solution to a critical fleet issue, Dr. Mark employed 
 leading-edge gear technology skills to assist TEAM SUBMARINE in innovative 
 measures which met significant challenges within the U. S. Navy submarine 
 community. 
 Dr. Mark, who joined ARL in 19 92, currently heads up the metrology 
 and performance prediction thrust within ARL's Drivetrain Technology Center. In this 
 capacity, he is responsible for developing fundamental theory and software for 
 predicting the transmission error of meshing parallel-axis and bevel gear pairs. He is 
 also developing methods for carrying out structural dynamics calculations. Dr. Mark 
 has developed fundamental definitions and interrelationships for the power spectra 
 of nonstationary random processes, the Wigner-Ville distribution, and intensity 
 modulated random processes. 
 Prior to his arrival at Penn State, Dr. Mark served as a principal scientist 
 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Incorporated. He also served as an officer and 
 physicist for the U. S. Air Force at the USAF Cambridge Research Laboratories. The 
 author of over 20 archival journal articles, four book chapters, and approximately 10 0 
 contractor reports, Dr. Mark also co-authored the book"Random Vibration in 
 Mechanical Systems,"(Academic Press, 19 63) with S. H. Crandell as senior author</NER>
