<NER>The paradox of unanimity has many other applications beyond the legal arena. 
One important one that the researchers discuss in their paper is cryptography. 
</NER><NER>
Data is often encrypted by verifying that some gigantic number provided by 
an adversary is prime or composite. One way to do this is to repeat a 
probabilistic test called the Rabin-Miller test until the probability 
that it mistakes a composite as prime is extremely low: a probability 
of 2-128 is typically considered acceptable.
</NER><NER>
The systemic failure that occurs in this situation is computer failure. 
</NER><NER>
Most people never consider the possibility that a stray cosmic ray 
may flip a bit that in turn causes the test to accept a composite 
number as a prime. After all, the probability for such an event 
occurring is extremely low, approximately 10-13 per month. 
</NER><NER>
But the important thing is that it's greater than 2-128,
so even though the failure rate is so tiny, it dominates over the 
desired level of security. Consequently, the cryptographic protocol 
may appear to be more secure than it really is, since test 
results that appear to indicate a high level of security are
 actually much more likely to be indicative of computer failure. 
 </NER><NER>
 In order to truly achieve the desirable level of security, 
 the researchers advise that these "hidden" errors must be 
 reduced to as close to zero as possible.
</NER>
<NER>
The paradox of unanimity may be counterintuitive, 
but the researchers explain that it makes sense once we have complete information at our disposal.
"As with most 'paradoxes,' it is not that our intuition is necessarily bad, 
but that our intuition has been badly informed," <PER>Abbott</PER> said. 
</NER><NER>
"In these cases, we are surprised because we simply aren't generally 
aware that identification rates by witnesses are in fact so poor, 
and we aren't aware that bit error rates in computers are significant when it comes to cryptography."
</NER><NER>

The researchers noted that the paradox of unanimity is related to the 
Duhem-Quine hypothesis, which states that it is not possible to 
test a scientific hypothesis in isolation, but rather hypotheses 
are always tested as a group. For instance, an experiment tests 
not only a certain phenomenon, but also the correction function of the
 experimental tools. In the paradox of unanimity, it's the methods 
 (the "auxiliary hypotheses") that fail, and in turn reduce confidence in the main results.
 </NER><NER>

More examples

Other areas where the paradox of unanimity emerges are numerous and diverse. 
<PER>Abbott</PER> describes several below, in his own words:

1) The recent Volkswagen scandal is a good example. 
</NER><NER>
The company fraudulently programmed a computer chip to run the 
engine in a mode that minimized diesel fuel emissions during emission tests. 
</NER><NER>
But in reality, the emissions did not meet standards when the cars were running on the road. 
</NER><NER>
The low emissions were too consistent and 'too good to be true.' 
The emissions team that outed Volkswagen initially got suspicious 
when they found that emissions were almost at the same level whether a
 car was new or five years old! The consistency betrayed the 
 systemic bias introduced by the nefarious computer chip.</NER>
 
 <NER>
2) A famous case where overwhelming evidence was 'too good to be true' occurred in the 1993-2008 period. 
</NER><NER>
Police in Europe found the same female DNA in about 15 crime scenes across 
France, Germany, and Austria. This mysterious killer was dubbed the Phantom of 
Heilbronn and the police never found her. The DNA evidence was consistent and
 overwhelming, yet it was wrong. It turned out to be a systemic error. 
 </NER><NER>
 The cotton swabs used to collect the DNA samples were accidentally contaminated, 
 by the same lady, in the factory that made the swabs.
</NER>
<NER>
3) When a government wins an election, one laments that the party 
of one's choice often wins with a relatively small margin.
</NER><NER>
 We often wish for our favored political party to win with unanimous votes.
 </NER><NER>
  However, should that ever happen we would be led to suspect a systemic 
  bias caused by vote rigging. An urban legend persists that <PER>Putin</PER> 
  won 140% (!) of the votes; if this true then democracy clearly failed in that case. 
  </NER><NER>
  The take-home message is that, in a healthy democracy, when a party wins by a small margin, 
  instead of name-calling the 'dumb' voters of the opposition, 
  we should be celebrating the fact that the opposing voters preserved the integrity of democracy.
</NER>
<NER>
4) In science, theory and experiment go hand in hand and must support each other. 
</NER><NER>
In every experiment there is always 'noise,' and we must therefore expect some error. 
</NER><NER>
In the history of science there are a number of famous experiments where the results were 
'too good to be true.' There are many examples that have been mired in controversy over 
the years, and the most famous are Millikan's oil drop experiment for determining
 the charge on the electron and Mendel's plant breeding experiments.
 </NER><NER>
  If results are too clean and do not contain expected noise and outliers, 
  then we can be led to suspect a form of confirmation bias introduced 
  by an experimenter who cherry-picks the data.
</NER>
<NER>
5) In many committee meetings, in today's big organizations, 
there is a trend towards the idea that decisions must be unanimous. 
</NER><NER>
For example, a committee that ranks job applicants or evaluates key 
performance indicators (KPIs) often will argue until everyone in the 
room is in agreement. If one or two members are in disagreement, 
there is a tendency for the rest of the committee to win them over
 before moving on. A take-home message of our analysis is that the 
 dissenting voice should be welcomed. A wise committee should accept
  that difference of opinion and simply record there was a disagreement.
  </NER><NER>
   The recording of the disagreement is not a negative, but a positive
    that demonstrates that a systemic bias is less likely.
</NER><NER>
6) <PER>Eugene Wigner</PER> once coined the phrase 'the unreasonable effectiveness
 of mathematics' to describe the rather odd feeling that math seems to be so 
 perfectly suited to describing physical theories. In a way, <PER>Wigner</PER> 
 was expressing the idea that math itself is 'too good to be true.' 
 </NER><NER>
 (See this article for more on this idea.) The reality is 
 that modern devices and machines are no longer analyzed by
  neat analytical mathematical equations, but by empirical formulas 
  embedded in simulation software tools. For some of the next big 
  science questions, particularly in the area of complex systems, 
  we are looking to big data and machine learning rather than math.
  </NER><NER> 
  Analytical math as we knew it was not the perfect glove that could
   fit every type of problem. So how did we get seduced to once thinking 
   that math was 'unreasonably effective'? It's the systemic confirmation
    bias introduced by the fact that for every great scientific paper 
    we read with an elegant formula, there are many more rejected formulas
     that are never published and we never get to see. 
     </NER><NER>
     The math we have 
     today was cherry-picked.

OKLAHOMA CITY –  
Authorities are responding to wildfires in Oklahoma and Kansas 
that have led to evacuations, scorched mostly rural land and destroyed 
an unknown number of structures.
</NER><NER>

In Oklahoma, the largest fire was in the same area near the border 
with Kansas where blazes last month scorched hundreds of square miles.
</NER><NER>


Authorities there urged the approximately 300 residents of Freedom, 
about 170 miles northwest of Oklahoma City, to evacuate, Woods County 
Emergency Management Director <PER>Steve Foster</PER> said.
</NER><NER>


The fire was burning uncontrolled, stoked by wind gusts of around 40 miles per hour, 
said Woodward County Emergency Management Director <PER>Matt Lehenbauer</PER>. 
</NER><NER>

By late evening Tuesday, the flames had stalled at the Cimarron River 
west of Freedom, but officials remained wary of its potential threat to the town.</NER>

A video that captured a retired U.S. Air Force sergeant being forcibly 
removed from a ceremony at a California base has prompted an investigation, 
an Air Force Reserve official said Wednesday.</NER><NER>


The incident occurred at Travis Air Force Base, near Sacramento on April 3, 
at the retirement of an unidentified master sergeant from the 749th Aircraft 
Maintenance Squadron. Retired Senior Master <PER>Sgt. Oscar Rodriguez</PER>, in civilian 
clothing, is shown attempting to read a statement before three uniformed airmen 
forcibly remove him.</NER><NER>


The 50-second video clip was first posted on JQPublicBlog.com, which 
called the footage “a disgraceful spectacle” during what is usually a calm send off.</NER><NER>


A source who was present at the event told the military blog that <PER>Rodriguez</PER> was 
there at the request of the retiree, but had been banned from the base by the squadron commander.
</NER><NER>


A spokesman from the reserve said that the confrontation stemmed from 
“an unplanned participation” at the event.

"<PER>Rodriguez</PER> ignored numerous requests to respect the Air Force prescribed ceremony
 and unfortunately was forcibly removed," a Travis official said in a statement 
to FoxNews.com. "We will continue to investigate the situation fully."
</NER><NER>


Neither <PER>Rodriguez</PER> nor the honoree could be reached for comment.
</NER><NER>


<PER>Stephan Sila</PER>, who identified himself as the officiating officer at the ceremony
 and a 28-year Air Force veteran, wrote in a Facebook post published on the military
 blog that <PER>Rodriguez</PER> simply planned to read a statement honoring the flag and 
that his appearance had been cleared through the proper chain of command.</NER><NER>


<PER>Sila</PER> said the incident has angered non-commissioned officers who believe the 
retirement ceremony was marred by the ugly incident.</NER><NER>


"Why do you think people are leaving (the Air Force) in droves?" <PER>Sila</PER> wrote. 
</NER><NER>

"Because the guys in the trenches are subjected to nonstop stupidity from 
commanders who don’t deserve the rank, respect, or support of the people ther’re in charge of.”</NER><NER>


The Air Force Reserve said in the statement it "respects and defends the right to
 free speech and religious expression." </NER>

State officials say a sewage leak has caused a major fish kill in a lake near 
the Mississippi River in west Tennessee.</NER><NER>


<PER>Kelly Brockman</PER>, a spokeswoman with the Tennessee's Department of Environment 
and Conservation, said Tuesday that the number of fish killed in McKellar 
Lake in Memphis is in the thousands.</NER><NER>


Officials say a broken sewage line is dumping up to 50 million gallons of 
untreated wastewater per day into Cypress Creek. 

</NER><NER>
The leak into the creek 
began Thursday. The creek runs into McKellar Lake, which flows into the 
Mississippi. Officials say the creek and the lake are not sources of drinking water.</NER><NER>


Officials have said the spill poses no immediate risk to the public, but they also
 said people should avoid touching or fishing in both bodies of water. </NER><NER>

City crews have placed warning signs in the area near the creek, and a 
marina that provides access to the lake has been closed.
</NER><NER>


Memphis public works officials have said a bypass around the damaged 
section of line is estimated to be in place on Wednesday.
</NER><NER>


Construction to replace the sewer line could take three to four months, 
with an estimated repair cost of $8 million to $10 million, said <PER>Robert Knecht</PER>, 
director of the Memphis Public Works Division.</NER>
<NER>
A team of Japanese researchers (and one from the U.K.) has found evidence 
in the remains of ancient Japanese people that suggests that people are not 
necessarily predisposed to living a violent existence or even to engaging 
in warfare. 
</NER>
<NER>
In their paper published in the Royal Society journal Biology 
Letters, the team describes their analysis of the remains of people that 
lived during the Jomon period (from 13,000 – 800 BC) in what is now Japan, 
which showed very little evidence of violent behavior or death.</NER>

<NER>
In recent years, scientists have found evidence of many hunter-gatherer 
groups that behaved in a violent manner, sometimes even banding together 
to wage war on other people or groups. </NER>
<NER>That has led to more evidence of the
 common assumption that humans are inherently violent and that war has 
generally been the result when two or more groups have different ideas 
of how things should be done. </NER>
<NER>In this new effort, the researchers suggest 
such findings might be premature as they have found an example of an early
 hunter-gatherer culture that did not appear to wage war or even behave in a violent manner.
</NER>
<NER>

The teams' study consisted of analyzing the remains of approximately 2,500 
people that lived in Japan during the Jomon period, looking for examples of 
violence, e.g. broken or damaged bones. </NER>
<NER>The team reports that they found 
evidence of violence in just 1.8 percent of all the adult bones represented 
and in just 0.89 percent of the population as a whole.</NER>
<NER> A very low number 
compared to the 12 to 14 percent seen in other hunter-gatherer populations 
of around the same time period (which strongly suggested a violent existence). 
This, the researchers claim, suggests that the people of that time lived 
peacefully among themselves and did not conduct war against others that 
might have lived nearby. </NER>
<NER>And that, they add, suggests that humans may not 
be quite as predisposed to violence as others have suggested, which counters other 
arguments that it was warfare that led people to band together into groups 
forming communities that allowed for the promotion of intra-group altruism 
and even more advanced warfare against other such groups—a selective from of 
evolutionary behavior.

<PER>Chevalier Blondin</PER> was 35 years old when in 1859, with no safety harness 
and no net beneath him, he first tightrope-walked nearly half a kilometre across 
the Niagara Gorge. </NER>
<NER>At different times over the coming years, 
he would repeat the crossing blindfolded, carrying a 
stove (stopping to cook himself an omelette half way), 
and with his manager on his back. </NER>
<NER>Later on, during a visit to the UK, 
he crossed a tightrope while pushing a wheelbarrow with a lion in it. 
<PER>Chevalier Blondin</PER> was a risk taker.</NER>
<NER>
In the same year as <PER>Blondin</PER>'s first Niagara crossing, 
<PER>Charles Darwin</PER> published On The Origin of Species by Natural Selection. </NER>
<NER>
There may seem to be a gulf the width of Niagara between these two events,
 but perhaps there is more to link them than is at first apparent.</NER>
<NER>
Some may find <PER>Blondin</PER>'s exploits admirable and inspirational. 
Others may think he was mad. The difference illustrates how individuals 
have remarkably different attitudes to risk. </NER>
<NER>Some take up extreme 
sports and visit war zones. Others view the ability to stay at home and 
live a quiet life as the happy privilege of the human species. </NER>
<NER>
But humans are not alone in having varying attitudes to risk.
 From field crickets to fighting fish and hermit crabs to hamsters, 
individuals differ consistently in their willingness to be exposed to risk.</NER>
<NER>
Behavioural ecologists call this spectrum of responses "boldness", 
and researchers in the field of animal personality variation are 
exploring its evolutionary significance.
</NER>
<NER>
The first question to address is why do some individuals take 
more risks than others? One answer is that in some cases,
 bolder individuals have higher reproductive success.

<NER>
A fruit called the noni—now hyped for a vast array of unproven health benefits—is distinctly 
unhealthy for the fruit fly, which has fascinated geneticists for a century. </NER>
<NER>
For the species of Drosophila that lives in labs around the world, 
noni signifies extermination with extreme prejudice: 
A fly will die if it eats yeast growing on noni.</NER>
<NER>
And yet when collectors swung nets and baited traps with rotting banana 
on a small island between Madagascar and Africa, they found a close relative, 
Drosophila yakuba, that merrily gobbles yeast growing on these forbidden fruits.</NER>
<NER>
Yeast growing on noni are the centerpiece on the islander fly's menu. 
But on the mainland, "D. yakuba is happy with whatever rotting fruit it can find, 
as long as it's not toxic," says <PER>John Pool</PER>, 
an assistant professor of genetics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
"They scrape off the yeast cells that grow on rotting fruit and eat them, 
and their larvae swim through the rotting fruit." <PER>Pool</PER> is senior author 
of a study on the discovery that appears in the April 4, 2016 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</NER>
<NER>
<PER>Pool</PER> says the toxin-surviving fruit flies on Mayotte are likely 
to become an important research subject for studying the evolution of dietary 
changes, "where we can borrow the genetic tools of the common laboratory fruit fly."</NER>
<NER>
The fruit fly is a workhorse of genetics, but "most fruit fly labs 
focus on experiments with a small set of lab strains," <PER>Pool</PER> says. </NER>
<NER>
"Our interest is using fruit flies to learn about evolution in the field." 
Because a different fruit fly had also evolved immunity to noni, 
"Yakuba gives us a chance to ask, how predictable are these transitions? 
Will they use the same genes, or do these organisms have a wider palette 
so they can make a completely different choice next time?"</NER>
<NER>
A collection effort on the island of Mayotte, led by <PER>Jean David</PER> 
of the French National Center for Scientific Research, identified the 
unusual Drosophila yakuba population and its bizarre preference for noni.
</NER>
<NER>
Female yakuba flies on Mayotte prefer not to mate with mainland males, 
<PER>Pool</PER> says, helping establish the reproductive isolation that supports 
evolution of a new species.</NER>
<NER>

"There were probably not that many options when these flies reached Mayotte," 
says Pool, "so they were stuck trying to survive on this toxic fruit."</NER>
<NER>

Genetic analysis indicated that the island flies developed their 
immunity to noni toxin after reaching Mayotte about 30,000 years 
ago—long after a similar transformation among Drosophila sechellia, 
another fruit fly in the region that also eats yeast from rotting noni.</NER>
<NER>

And that raised the most intriguing question of all: </NER>
<NER>How closely 
did the two genetic transformations parallel each other?</NER>
<NER>

In Pool's lab, postdoctoral fellow <PER>Amir Yassin</PER> broke that question 
into one about the flies' attraction to noni, and a second about its 
immunity to noni toxin.</NER>
<NER> "We did not see a strong signal of genetic 
parallelism in the evolution of attraction, but we did for the tolerance
 genes that render the toxin harmless," <PER>Pool</PER> says. 
"So not only had the 
same trait evolved in two species, but at least some of the same genes were involved."

Finding a fly that had recently changed its dining habits was intriguing
 for a very practical reason, says <PER>Pool</PER>, 
observing that most agricultural 
insect pests undergo a change of menu before they start to attack crops.
