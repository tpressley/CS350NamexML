New fishery regulations based on science are needed in the 
Caribbean to give coral reefs a fighting chance against climate change, 
according to an international study published today.

The study, led by University of Queensland researchers, 
reveals that Caribbean coral reefs are experiencing mounting pressure 
from global warming, local pollution and over-fishing of herbivorous fish.

Study author Dr Yves-Marie Bozec, from UQ's School of Biological Sciences 
and the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, said herbivorous 
parrotfish were needed because they eat seaweed, which can smother coral and prevent corals from recovering.

"While several countries in the Caribbean have taken the bold step of 
banning the fishing of parrotfish (including Belize, Bonaire, Turks and Caicos Islands), 
parrotfish fisheries remain in much of the region," <PER>Dr Bozec</PER> said.

The research team analysed the effects of fishing on 
parrotfish and combined this with an analysis of the role of parrotfish on coral reefs.

"We conclude that unregulated fisheries will seriously reduce the 
resilience of coral reefs," <PER>Dr Bozec</PER> said.

"However, implementation of size limits and catch limits to less than 
10 per cent of the fishable stock provide a far better outlook for reefs, 
while also allowing the fishery to persist."

Study co-author Professor <PER>Peter Mumby</PER> from UQ's School of Biological 
Sciences said a number of countries wanted to modify their fisheries to reduce impacts on reefs.

"What we've done is identify fisheries' policies that might help achieve this," <PER>Professor Mumby</PER> said.

The new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 
argues that science should be used to revise current fisheries practices for herbivorous fish.

The authors have provided tools to help fisheries managers make such changes.

"Ultimately, the more we do to maintain healthy coral reefs, the more likely it is that fishers'
 livelihoods will be sustained into the future," <PER>Professor Mumby</PER> said.

"We already know that failure to maintain coral habitats will lead to at least a threefold reduction 
in future fish catches."
