The silver electrical contacts that carry electricity out of about 
90 percent of the solar modules on the market are also one of their most expensive parts. 
Now scientists from two Department of Energy national laboratories have 
used X-rays to observe exactly how those contacts form during manufacturing.

The results, reported in Nature Communications, are an important step toward finding cheaper 
alternatives to silver that don't require toxic lead for processing.

"Industry would like to get rid of both silver and lead in this process," said <PER>Mike Toney</PER>, 
a distinguished staff scientist at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and one of the lead authors of the paper. 
"One of the goals of this research is to figure out how the contacts are made and use 
this knowledge to come up with ways to eliminate silver and lead."

"I won't say we have the full story yet, but this is the first time we actually got some 
insight into what's happening," said <PER>Maikel van Hest</PER>, a materials scientist at 
NREL who led the research. 
"Prior to this study we were only able to look at the contact before and after heat processing; 
what happened in between was like a black box. But now we can actually make measurements as 
the contacts form. This tool will have great impact in the photovoltaic industry as well as in basic research."

NREL's <PER>Jeremy Fields</PER> and SLAC's <PER>Mohammed Imteyaz Ahmad</PER> were first authors of the paper 
and played leading roles in carrying out the experiments. 
Other scientists involved in the research were NREL's <PER>Philip Parilla</PER> and 
SLAC's <PER>Vanessa Pool</PER>, <PER>Jiafan Yu</PER> and <PER>Douglas Van Campen</PER>. 
The research was funded by the DOE's SunShot Initiative, 
which aims to make solar energy cost-competitive with other forms of electricity by the end of the decade. </NER>
