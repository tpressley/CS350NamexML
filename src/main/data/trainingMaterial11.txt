The first results of textile and dye analyses of cloth dated between 
400-650 AD and recovered from Samdzong 5, in Upper Mustang, Nepal 
have today been released by <PER>Dr Margarita Gleba</PER> of the 
McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge.
</NER><NER>
Identification of degummed silk fibres and munjeet and Indian lac dyes in the 
textile finds suggests that imported materials from China and India 
were used in combination with those locally produced. 
Says <PER>Gleba</PER>: "There is no evidence for local silk production 
suggesting that Samdzong was inserted into the long-distance trade network of the Silk Road."
</NER><NER>
"The data reinforce the notion that instead of being isolated and remote, 
Upper Mustang was once a small, but important node of a much larger network of 
people and places. These textiles can further our understanding of the 
local textile materials and techniques, as well as the mechanisms through 
which various communities developed and adapted new textile technologies to fit local cultural and economical needs."

<NER>
The cloth remains are of further significance as very few contemporary 
textile finds are known from Nepal. 
The dry climate and high altitude of the Samdzong tomb complex, at an elevation of 4000 m, 
favoured the exceptional preservation of the organic materials.</NER>

Samdzong 5 is one of ten shaft tombs excavated by <PER>Mark Aldenderfer</PER>, 
(University of California Merced and Visiting Scholar of the McDonald Institute). 
The tombs were only exposed to view in 2009 following a seismic event that calved 
off the façade of the cliff, having been originally carved out in prehistory 
from the soft conglomerate rock of a massive cliff face.

Under ancient Jewish law, if a suspect on trial was unanimously found guilty by all judges, 
then the suspect was acquitted. This reasoning sounds counterintuitive, 
but the legislators of the time had noticed that unanimous agreement often indicates 
the presence of systemic error in the judicial process, 
even if the exact nature of the error is yet to be discovered. 
They intuitively reasoned that when something seems too good to be true, most likely a mistake was made.</NER>
<NER>
In a new paper to be published in The Proceedings of The Royal Society A, a team of researchers, 
<PER>Lachlan J. Gunn</PER>, et al., from Australia and France has further investigated 
this idea, which they call the "paradox of unanimity."
"If many independent witnesses unanimously testify to the identity of a suspect of a crime, 
we assume they cannot all be wrong," coauthor <PER>Derek Abbott</PER>, 
a physicist and electronic engineer at The University of Adelaide, Australia, 
told Phys.org. "Unanimity is often assumed to be reliable. However, it turns out that the probability 
of a large number of people all agreeing is small, 
so our confidence in unanimity is ill-founded. 
This 'paradox of unanimity' shows that often we are far less certain than we think."</NER>
<NER>
Unlikely agreement
The researchers demonstrated the paradox in the case of a modern-day police 
line-up, in which witnesses try to identify the suspect out of a line-up of several people. 
The researchers showed that, as the group of unanimously agreeing witnesses increases, 
the chance of them being correct decreases until it is no better than a random guess.</NER>
<NER>
In police line-ups, the systemic error may be any kind of bias, 
such as how the line-up is presented to the witnesses or a personal bias held by 
the witnesses themselves. Importantly, the researchers showed that even a tiny bit of 
bias can have a very large impact on the results overall. 
Specifically, they show that when only 1% of the line-ups exhibit a bias toward 
a particular suspect, the probability that the witnesses are correct 
begins to decrease after only three unanimous identifications. 
Counterintuitively, if one of the many witnesses were to identify a different suspect, 
then the probability that the other witnesses were correct would substantially increase.</NER>
<NER>
The mathematical reason for why this happens is found using 
Bayesian analysis, which can be understood in a simplistic way by 
looking at a biased coin. If a biased coin is designed to land on heads 55% of the time, 
then you would be able to tell after recording enough coin tosses 
that heads comes up more often than tails. 
The results would not indicate that the laws of probability for a binary system 
have changed, but that this particular system has failed. 
In a similar way, getting a large group of unanimous witnesses is so unlikely, 
according to the laws of probability, that it's more likely that the system is unreliable.</NER>
<NER>
The researchers say that this paradox crops up more often than we might think. 
Large, unanimous agreement does remain a good thing in certain cases, 
but only when there is zero or near-zero bias. 
<PER>Abbott</PER> gives an example in which witnesses must identify an apple 
in a line-up of bananas—a task that is so easy, it is nearly impossible to get wrong, 
and therefore large, unanimous agreement becomes much more likely.
On the other hand, a criminal line-up is much more complicated than one with an apple among bananas. 
Experiments with simulated crimes have shown misidentification 
rates as high as 48% in cases where the witnesses see the perpetrator only briefly as 
he runs away from a crime scene. In these situations, it would be highly unlikely to find large, 
unanimous agreement. But in a situation where the witnesses had each been independently 
held hostage by the perpetrator at gunpoint for a month, the misidentification 
rate would be much lower than 48%, and so the magnitude of the effect would likely be closer 
to that of the banana line-up than the one with briefly seen criminals.
