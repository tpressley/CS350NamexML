It's not everyday that you get to discover something new. 
But when you do it is a rather strange and quite brilliant feeling. 
You don't really cry out 'Eureka' 
(there's usually about a million things going about it your head pointing out how it could be wrong).</NER>
<NER>When you finally conquer the 'wrong' demon and satisfy yourself that you have something new, 
well then you usually sit back in your chair and smile to yourself. 
Maybe at a push grab a cup of coffee and a celebratory chocolate bar 
from the vending machine. That's pretty much how I felt when I worked out the latest 
crystal structure I've just published, of the 'bath scum' of Titan.</NER>

<NER>The great thing about this column space is that I can use it to tell you all 
the back-story behind a paper, how it came about and why I think it's really exciting.

Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is in many ways pretty similar to Earth. 
It's the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere, 
much thicker than our own. If you don't mind the cold and lack of oxygen, 
moving about the surface there will feel a bit like walking under water. 
It's pretty nice when you consider that the atmosphere most other planets 
and moons will barely shield you from the vacuum of space.

The other similarity with our own home is that Titan has liquid on the surface, 
vast lakes and seas. It's the only other place we know where you can watch 
the sun set into a sea (albeit very very slowly). But, where our seas are 
composed of water, the seas and lakes of Titan are filled with methane and ethane, 
which are liquid at the frigid temperatures on the surface (around -180°C). 
And in fact, the Cassini spacecraft and the team of scientists behind it, 
have gone further than just the discovery of standing liquid - 
they have shown that Titan has a kind of hydrological cycle.

MIT researchers have developed a compact, portable pharmaceutical manufacturing system 
that can be reconfigured to produce a variety of drugs on demand.
Just as an emergency generator supplies electricity to handle a power outage, 
this system could be rapidly deployed to produce drugs needed to handle 
an unexpected disease outbreak, or to prevent a drug shortage caused 
by a manufacturing plant shutdown, the researchers say.

"Think of this as the emergency backup for pharmaceutical manufacturing," says 
<PER>Allan Myerson</PER>, an MIT professor of the practice in the Department of Chemical Engineering. 
"The purpose is not to replace traditional manufacturing; it's to provide an alternative for these special situations."

Such a system could also be used to produce small quantities of drugs needed for clinical trials 
or to treat rare diseases, says <PER>Klavs Jensen</PER>, the Warren K. Lewis Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT.

"The goal of this project was to build a small-scale, portable unit that was completely integrated, 
so you could imagine being able to ship it anywhere. And as long as you had the right chemicals, 
you could make pharmaceuticals," <PER>Jensen</PER> says.

<PER>Jensen</PER>, <PER>Myerson</PER>, and <PER>Timothy Jamison</PER>, the head of MIT's Department of Chemistry, 
are the senior authors of a paper describing the new system in the March 31 online 
edition of Science. The lead author is MIT research associate <PER>Andrea Adamo</PER>.
