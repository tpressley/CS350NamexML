A fruit called the noni—now hyped for a vast array of unproven health benefits—is distinctly 
unhealthy for the fruit fly, which has fascinated geneticists for a century. 
For the species of Drosophila that lives in labs around the world, 
noni signifies extermination with extreme prejudice: 
A fly will die if it eats yeast growing on noni.</NER>
<NER>
And yet when collectors swung nets and baited traps with rotting banana 
on a small island between Madagascar and Africa, they found a close relative, 
Drosophila yakuba, that merrily gobbles yeast growing on these forbidden fruits.</NER>
<NER>
Yeast growing on noni are the centerpiece on the islander fly's menu. 
But on the mainland, "D. yakuba is happy with whatever rotting fruit it can find, 
as long as it's not toxic," says <PER>John Pool</PER>, 
an assistant professor of genetics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
"They scrape off the yeast cells that grow on rotting fruit and eat them, 
and their larvae swim through the rotting fruit." <PER>Pool</PER> is senior author 
of a study on the discovery that appears in the April 4, 2016 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
<PER>Pool</PER> says the toxin-surviving fruit flies on Mayotte are likely 
to become an important research subject for studying the evolution of dietary 
changes, "where we can borrow the genetic tools of the common laboratory fruit fly."</NER>
<NER>
The fruit fly is a workhorse of genetics, but "most fruit fly labs 
focus on experiments with a small set of lab strains," <PER>Pool</PER> says. 
"Our interest is using fruit flies to learn about evolution in the field." 
Because a different fruit fly had also evolved immunity to noni, 
"Yakuba gives us a chance to ask, how predictable are these transitions? 
Will they use the same genes, or do these organisms have a wider palette 
so they can make a completely different choice next time?"</NER>
<NER>
A collection effort on the island of Mayotte, led by <PER>Jean David</PER> 
of the French National Center for Scientific Research, identified the 
unusual Drosophila yakuba population and its bizarre preference for noni.
</NER>
<NER>
Female yakuba flies on Mayotte prefer not to mate with mainland males, 
<PER>Pool</PER> says, helping establish the reproductive isolation that supports 
evolution of a new species.</NER>
<NER>

"There were probably not that many options when these flies reached Mayotte," 
says Pool, "so they were stuck trying to survive on this toxic fruit."</NER>
<NER>

Genetic analysis indicated that the island flies developed their 
immunity to noni toxin after reaching Mayotte about 30,000 years 
ago—long after a similar transformation among Drosophila sechellia, 
another fruit fly in the region that also eats yeast from rotting noni.

And that raised the most intriguing question of all: How closely 
did the two genetic transformations parallel each other?</NER>
<NER>

In Pool's lab, postdoctoral fellow <PER>Amir Yassin</PER> broke that question 
into one about the flies' attraction to noni, and a second about its 
immunity to noni toxin. "We did not see a strong signal of genetic 
parallelism in the evolution of attraction, but we did for the tolerance
 genes that render the toxin harmless," <PER>Pool</PER> says. 
"So not only had the 
same trait evolved in two species, but at least some of the same genes were involved."

Finding a fly that had recently changed its dining habits was intriguing
 for a very practical reason, says <PER>Pool</PER>, 
observing that most agricultural 
insect pests undergo a change of menu before they start to attack crops.
