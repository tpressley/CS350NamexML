<NER>A team of archeologists has found what may be the remains of a previously unknown 
Viking settlement on a south west shore of the Island of Newfoundland. 
If the remains can be confirmed, the site would make it just the second ever discovered 
that has given proof of Vikings inhabiting parts of North America. 
The team has been videotaping their work and a documentary of their efforts will be presented this month on PBS.

Leading the research is archeologist and National Geographic fellow, <PER>Sarah Parcak</PER>, 
who has been described as a "space archaeologist" because of her groundbreaking use of 
satellite technology to uncover Egyptian ruins. In this latest effort, 
she and her team have altered their methods to uncover what appears to be evidence of Viking iron smelting.

To find hidden artifacts, especially those that have been buried by some amount of dirt, 
using a satellite, the researchers used computer tools to help them scan images, 
looking for human-like angles or long straight, unnatural lines. 
In the case of the newly discovered Newfoundland site, called Point Rosee/Plc, 
the team looked for changes in the richness of the grasses that grow near 
the sea—those that grow over stone, or other material are less robust, 
and can be made out from a distant satellite. 
The team also used magnetometer surveys to help isolate images below the ground 
once they were on site. That led to an initial excavation which revealed an iron-working hearth 
(with 28 pounds of slag in it) and what appeared to be the remains of turf walls. 
Radiocarbon testing has dated the site to between 800 and 1300 AD, 
which would coincide with the time of the Vikings.

Prior to this possible discovery, the only site ever officially designated as evidence of 
Norse activity in the New World was L'Anse aux Meadows, hundreds of miles north, 
on the tip of the same island. Archeologists do not have much to go on when attempting 
to prove that a settlement was made by Norsemen, rather than Basque fisherman or 
Native Americans—the one true hallmark of Norse travelers was the use of iron nails 
to build their boats, thus the discovery of an iron-smelting oven would be strong evidence of Viking activity.

If additional excavation and testing indicate that the site was indeed made by Vikings, 
it will likely lead to changes being made to the history books—it would mean 
they found and settled North America almost half a century before <PER>Christopher Columbus</PER> arrived. </NER>

A bullet fired by <PER>Lawrence of Arabia</PER> during one of his most famous acts 
of guerrilla warfare has been discovered in the Arabian desert by a team of archaeologists, 
led by the University of Bristol, confirming the accuracy of <PER>Lawrence</PER>'s own account 
of the attack in his war memoir Seven Pillars of Wisdom.

The spent bullet was found at the site of the 1917 Hallat Ammar train ambush – immortalised 
in a scene in <PER>David Lean</PER>'s Oscar-winning biopic Lawrence of Arabia – 
during fieldwork by Bristol's Professor <PER>Nicholas Saunders</PER> and <PER>Dr Neil Faulkner</PER>, 
and colleagues, as part of the Great Arab Revolt Project (GARP).  

The project has excavated dozens of sites across the Arabian desert associated 
with the 1916-1918 revolt by Arab forces against the Ottoman Turks, then allied to Germany.  
<PER>T.E. Lawrence</PER> – later known as <PER>Lawrence of Arabia</PER> – served as 
a liaison officer with the rebel forces, an experience he described in Seven Pillars of Wisdom.

Professor <PER>Nicholas Saunders</PER> said: "The bullet we found came from a Colt automatic pistol, 
the type of gun known to be carried by <PER>Lawrence</PER> and almost certainly 
not used by any of the ambush's other participants."

While several of <PER>Lawrence</PER>'s biographers have accused him of embellishing his stories, 
nothing the archaeologists found at any of the sites they excavated supports this view.
