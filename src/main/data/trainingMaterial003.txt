A team of archeologists has found what may be the remains of a previously unknown 
Viking settlement on a south west shore of the Island of Newfoundland. 
</NER><NER>
If the remains can be confirmed, the site would make it just the second ever discovered 
that has given proof of Vikings inhabiting parts of North America. 
</NER><NER>
The team has been videotaping their work and a documentary of their efforts will be presented this month on PBS.
</NER><NER>

Leading the research is archeologist and National Geographic fellow, <PER>Sarah Parcak</PER>, 
who has been described as a "space archaeologist" because of her groundbreaking use of 
satellite technology to uncover Egyptian ruins. 
</NER><NER>
In this latest effort, 
she and her team have altered their methods to uncover what appears to be evidence of Viking iron smelting.
</NER><NER>

To find hidden artifacts, especially those that have been buried by some amount of dirt, 
using a satellite, the researchers used computer tools to help them scan images, 
looking for human-like angles or long straight, unnatural lines. 
</NER><NER>
In the case of the newly discovered Newfoundland site, called Point Rosee/Plc, 
the team looked for changes in the richness of the grasses that grow near 
the sea—those that grow over stone, or other material are less robust, 
and can be made out from a distant satellite. 
</NER><NER>
The team also used magnetometer surveys to help isolate images below the ground 
once they were on site. That led to an initial excavation which revealed an iron-working hearth 
(with 28 pounds of slag in it) and what appeared to be the remains of turf walls. 
</NER><NER>
Radiocarbon testing has dated the site to between 800 and 1300 AD, 
which would coincide with the time of the Vikings.
</NER><NER>

Prior to this possible discovery, the only site ever officially designated as evidence of 
Norse activity in the New World was L'Anse aux Meadows, hundreds of miles north, 
on the tip of the same island. 
</NER><NER>
Archeologists do not have much to go on when attempting 
to prove that a settlement was made by Norsemen, rather than Basque fisherman or 
Native Americans—the one true hallmark of Norse travelers was the use of iron nails 
to build their boats, thus the discovery of an iron-smelting oven would be strong evidence of Viking activity.
</NER><NER>

If additional excavation and testing indicate that the site was indeed made by Vikings, 
it will likely lead to changes being made to the history books—it would mean 
they found and settled North America almost half a century before <PER>Christopher Columbus</PER> arrived. </NER>

A bullet fired by <PER>Lawrence of Arabia</PER> during one of his most famous acts 
of guerrilla warfare has been discovered in the Arabian desert by a team of archaeologists, 
led by the University of Bristol, confirming the accuracy of <PER>Lawrence</PER>'s own account 
of the attack in his war memoir Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
</NER><NER>
The spent bullet was found at the site of the 1917 Hallat Ammar train ambush – immortalised 
in a scene in <PER>David Lean</PER>'s Oscar-winning biopic Lawrence of Arabia – 
during fieldwork by Bristol's Professor <PER>Nicholas Saunders</PER> and <PER>Dr Neil Faulkner</PER>, 
and colleagues, as part of the Great Arab Revolt Project (GARP).  
</NER><NER>
The project has excavated dozens of sites across the Arabian desert associated 
with the 1916-1918 revolt by Arab forces against the Ottoman Turks, then allied to Germany.  
<PER>T.E. Lawrence</PER> – later known as <PER>Lawrence of Arabia</PER> – served as 
a liaison officer with the rebel forces, an experience he described in Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
</NER><NER>
Professor <PER>Nicholas Saunders</PER> said: "The bullet we found came from a Colt automatic pistol, 
the type of gun known to be carried by <PER>Lawrence</PER> and almost certainly 
not used by any of the ambush's other participants."
</NER><NER>
While several of <PER>Lawrence</PER>'s biographers have accused him of embellishing his stories, 
nothing the archaeologists found at any of the sites they excavated supports this view.

WASHINGTON - Congressional officials say the Obama administration has decided 
to transfer leftover money from the largely successful fight against Ebola to 
combat the growing threat of the Zika virus in Puerto Rico, the Southeast U.S., 
and Central and South America.</NER>


Most of the $600 million or so would be devoted to the Centers for Disease Control, 
</NER><NER>
which is focused on research and development of anti-Zika vaccines, treating those 
</NER><NER>
infected with the virus and combating the mosquitoes that spread it.

Researchers fear Zika causes microcephaly, a serious birth defect, and other threats 
to the children of pregnant women infected with it.
</NER><NER>
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to 
publicly discuss the matter before an official announcement expected from the White House on Wednesday.
</NER><NER>

Below is a breakdown, by county, of the number of cases of Zika in Florida. 
</NER><NER>
The state's health department says all 79 cases of Zika so far have been contracted 
either while traveling abroad, or directly from someone who had recently.</NER>

Amid rumors that Apple plans to release a dual camera feature in the iPhone 7 Plus, 
Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei today unveiled the Huawei P9 and P9 Plus, 
a set of smartphones that are equipped with impressive dual camera setups with some 
interesting capabilities. 
</NER><NER>

The 5.2 and 5.5-inch P9 and P9 Plus both come with dual 12-megapixel rear cameras

</NER><NER>
 equipped with Leica-certified lenses. Hardware wise, the lenses include 1.25-micron 

</NER><NER>
pixel sizes for superior low light performance and an f/1.1 aperture, which will also 
improve performance in poor lighting conditions. 
</NER><NER>
There's also built-in optical image 
stabilization, a dual-tone LED flash, and a laser focusing module that works in tandem 
with the two cameras for faster focusing at short ranges. </NER>

 North Carolina's governor met Thursday with gay-rights advocates bearing a letter 
signed by more than 100 corporate executives urging him to repeal the nation's 
first state law limiting the bathroom options for transgender people.
</NER><NER>

The law also excludes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from 
anti-discrimination protections, and blocks municipalities from adopting their 
own anti-discrimination and living wage rules.
</NER><NER>

The governor "appreciated the opportunity to sit down and deal with these 
complex issues through conversation and dialogue as opposed to political 
threats and economic retaliation," his spokesman, <PER>Josh Ellis</PER>, said in a statement.
</NER><NER>

The advocates declined to describe <PER>Gov. Pat McCrory</PER>'s response.

New Jersey-based Braeburn Pharmaceuticals said it is 
"reevaluating our options based on the recent, unjust legislation" whether 
to build a $20 million manufacturing and research facility in Durham County.

 The 50 new jobs paying an average of nearly $76,000 a year were announced two weeks ago.


Lionsgate, the California-based entertainment company, had been lining up hotel

 to shoot its pilot episode for a comedy series in Canada instead, said <PER>Jennifer Irvine</PER>,
 a Charlotte production coordinator.

Charlotte convention officials and the organizers of one of the world's largest
 furniture markets say some customers have pulled out, also citing the new law.

Changing business plans is much more difficult for companies with existing investments
 in buildings, equipment and people, but the outsized lobbying power of major 
corporations could reshape how prospective talent and investors perceive North 
Carolina as a place they want to be, business observers said.
</NER><NER>

"These companies have made long-term investments or are thinking about long-term 
investments in North Carolina" and won't likely retreat solely due to this law, 
said <PER>DJ Peterson</PER>, who advises companies on political, social and economic issues 
as founder of Longview Global Advisors, a Los Angeles consulting firm.
</NER><NER>

But as businesses showed Georgia this week, "the political pressure, the visibility 
they're bringing to the issue, politicians do have to pay attention to it," <PER>Peterson</PER> said.
