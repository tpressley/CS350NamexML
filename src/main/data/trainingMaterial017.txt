Researchers at Yale and the Smithsonian Institution 
say it's time to settle a very old food fight.
</NER><NER>

In a study published March 18 in the journal Ecology and 
Evolution, authors <PER>Matt Davis</PER> and <PER>Silvia Pineda-Munoz</PER> argue 

that scientists need to focus as much on "when" animals eat 
as they do "what" animals eat. Without the proper time context, 
they say, an animal's diet can tell very different stories.

"Diet is one of the most important features of animals," 
said <PER>Davis</PER>, a Yale graduate student in geology and geophysics. 
"But often, we can't seem to agree on what animals ate. 
Grizzly bears, for example, eat different foods at different times. 
If you looked at their diet in the spring, it would look like what
 wolves eat, but in the fall, bears eat mostly seeds, just like squirrels."

Researchers use diet reconstructions to provide crucial information
 for managing habitats of endangered species, understanding evolutionary 
changes in species' function, and describing ancient habitats
</NER><NER>

 and climates. Routinely, this bit of diet detective work is 
achieved with dietary proxies: chemicals in hair or blood samples, 
dental remains, stomach contents, skeletal analysis, and
 measurements of feeding sites, for example.
</NER><NER>

Yet often, diet proxies don't agree. This is because each one records 
what an animal eats over different lengths of time. Chemicals in hair, 
for example, may offer information about nutrition over the course of
</NER><NER>

 several years; stomach contents would reveal perhaps a week's worth 
of meals. Each could give a different answer for what an animal ate.
</NER><NER>

<PER>Davis</PER> and <PER>Pineda-Munoz</PER> give 
examples of how such disparity can be 
problematic in research. In one instance, scientists unintentionally
 reversed the order of a food chain in a lake in East Africa because 
</NER><NER>

they hadn't factored in the different speeds that zooplankton and their 
predators absorb nutrients. In another, researchers thought that certain 
regions of ancient Africa were covered in forests because they 
</NER><NER>

assumed the fossil elephants they found there ate mostly trees, just 
like modern elephants; however chemical analysis showed the ancient 
</NER><NER>

elephants actually ate mostly grass, so the "forests" were most likely fields.
</NER><NER>

"The correct diet proxy depends on the question you're asking," Davis 
said. "We can't just look at stomach contents sampled yesterday 
and extrapolate them out for 1 million years."
</NER><NER>

<PER>Davis</PER> and <PER>Pineda-Munoz</PER> suggest that 
researchers explicitly state the 
time scales for the diet proxies they use to avoid confusion. They 
also call upon scientists to consider the effects of time scale at each 
stage of their research.
</NER><NER>

<PER>Pineda-Munoz</PER> points out that the different 
time scales can actually 
be helpful to research. "By using different proxies like the chemical 
signatures in feathers and blood we can tell not just what a bird is
</NER><NER>

 eating but what it ate a year ago and how its diet changed since then," 
she said. "This is especially important for rare or endangered species 
because we can effectively time travel through their diet without harming 
the animal."
