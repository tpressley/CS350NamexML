Strong fists for defending ourselves and opposable thumbs 
for work as fine as threading a needle—hand specialisation
 is widely believed to have given humans a major evolutionary 
advantage.
</NER><NER>

On Tuesday, scientists in the United States and Spain said 
the human hand may be more primitive than that of our closest
 living cousin, the chimpanzee.
</NER><NER>
In fact, human hands are likely more similar to those of the 
last common ancestor we and chimps shared millions of years ago.
</NER><NER>
"These findings indicate that the structure of the modern
 human hand is largely primitive in nature, rather than the 
result of selective pressures in the context of stone tool-making,"
 said a press summary from the journal Nature Communications, 
which published the study.
</NER><NER>
In fact, it is the hands of chimps and orangutans that changed 
most since they split off to form new branches of the hominid 
family tree—developing longer fingers, compared to the thumb, 
for swinging on tree branches.
</NER><NER>
The human hand has a longer thumb relative to the other fingers 
than that of chimps and other apes—allowing for what scientists 
call "pad-to-pad" precision grasping, which simply means that our
 fingertips are able to touch.

There is a widely held assumption among palaeontologists that the 
last common ancestor (LCA) of humans and apes, an individual whose
 identity remains uncertain, was a prototype chimp with chimp-like hands.
</NER><NER>
But a team led by <PER>Sergio Almecija</PER> of The George Washington University's
 Center for the Advanced Study of Human Paleobiology, is challenging that.
</NER><NER>
They analysed the hand-length proportions of humans, as well as 
living and fossil apes to draw a picture of the evolutionary history, 
and found the human "thumb-to-digits ratio required little change since the LCA."
</NER><NER>
"The inevitable implication is that when hominins (the extended human 
family excluding apes) started producing flaked stone tools in a 
systematic fashion, probably as early as 3.3 million years ago, 
their hands were—in terms of overall proportions—pretty much like 
ours today," <PER>Almecija</PER> told AFP by email.
</NER><NER>
"Another important take-home message is that if human hands are 
largely primitive, the 'relevant' changes promoting the emergence 
of widespread reliance on stone tool culture were probably neurological" 
and not manual—meaning it was our brains that allowed for adaptation.
</NER><NER>
"Any evolutionary model of human hand evolution assuming a 
chimpanzee-like ancestor will likely be flawed from the beginning," he added.

Australia's largest predator, the dingo, is resistant 
to one of the main threats to its survival as a species—changes 
to skull shape brought about by cross breeding (hybridisation) 
with dogs, research shows.
</NER><NER>

A UNSW study published today in Evolutionary Biology has found 
the dingo skull shape remains unchanged by cross breeding, 
</NER><NER>
overturning long-held fears that cross breeding may result in 
the loss of the predator's ecological niche.
</NER><NER>
"We know that cross breeding has an effect on the dingo gene pool 
but what we didn't know until now is whether cross breeding changes 
the dingo skull," said study lead author <PER>Dr William Parr</PER>, 
Postdoctoral Research Fellow at UNSW Medicine's Surgical and Orthopaedic Research Laboratory.
</NER><NER>
"This study has shown us that the dingo skull shape, which in 
part determines feeding ability, is more dominant than dog skull
 shapes," <PER>Dr Parr</PER> said.
</NER><NER>
Conservationists and ecologists had worried that any change in 
the animals' skull shape through hybridisation could alter 
</NER><NER>
feeding habits, potentially causing knock-on effects throughout the entire ecosystem.
</NER><NER>
The UNSW research team used medical CT (computed tomography)
 scanners to make 3D models of the skulls of dingoes, domestic 
dogs and hybrids. 
</NER><NER>
They then used sophisticated 3D shape analyses 
to determine whether skulls could be correctly assigned to one of
the three groups based on their shape.
